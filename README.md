#### Strategy 

- The strategy of the website is to feel minimalist and friendly, like a local homemade bakery should. As we are targeting local people, I aimed for a user-friendly design that avoided being too wordy. 

#### Scope

- We want customers to gain a feel for Moiras baking and what she has to offer. I am aiming to showcase her professional training all the while impressing with the homemade nature of the baked goods, as this is our USP. 

## Structure

The website is split into three pages. You are able to navigate between the pages by using the NAV bar at the top right of each page. The logo also brings you back to the home page if clicked.

#### Colour scheme

The tan colour of the logo and headers was selected to remind the user of the colour of freshly baked bread. This was matched with occasional green to showcase the fresh nature of the products on a white minimalist backdrop. 

#### Images

The images were downloaded from Google Images and resized for the purpose of this project. These will be replaced by Moiras own baking should she choose to continue with the business.
